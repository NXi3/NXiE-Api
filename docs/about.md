# NXiE
###### A new way to interact with the world

For a long time, I've been wanting to develop this platform and I have tried to garner this idea, in order to get finance and develop the idea further.
I've also tried many variations of producing the idea, but I've never been able to get the idea to work. Well not until now.

Many years of research, development and testing has gone into this project, and I'm proud to say that I have finally developed a platform that can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime, even with
restricted access to the internet. By utilising the lower frequencies of GSM, as well as the higher frequencies of WiFi, 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies, we can create a worldwide network,
that is 100% decentralised, protects users data from point of use to point of use, and is completely free from any form of censorship.

The platform is called NXiE, and it is a platform that allows users to interact with the world, in a way that has never been done before or not used to the full potential of it's capabilites and this is what
I do best, I take a technology and use it in a way it's not supposed to be used, but is actually programmed to be used that way.

* Cryptography, but without the currency, but still using a 'Crypto Market'
* Data Protection and Privacy, but without the need for a VPN and at point of use
* Decentralised, but without the need for a blockchain, storing data on the device itself and in Hex format, with handshake encryption.

These are just some of the things I want to achieve with this platform, what we can do with technology, is only limited by our imagination, and I want to push the boundaries of what we can do.

Using mobile technology, we can create ways we can interact with each other directly, forget AR and VR, but what about AVR (Augmented Virtual Reality), where we can interact with the world around us directly,
 be in China one minute, and in the UK the next, without the need for a plane ticket, or even a passport.

As I said, thinking inside the box is not what I do, I think outside the box, and I want to push the boundaries of what we can do with technology, and I want to do it with you.
